## The Story
Due to the [high rate of inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/south-africa/inflation-cpi), [buying monthly groceries has become a sport](https://www.thesouthafrican.com/lifestyle/south-african-food-prices-now-more-expensive-than-the-uk/). One has to go to the ends of the world in order to good prices on the
items they need.
When doing a monthly grocery list one has to go through countless catalogues or websites to track down good prices or promotions, and that to me is very time consuming.

Overtime I started to get annoyed and decided to create a Python script that
would search for the items I have listed in a Google spreadsheet across some
of the major online shops in the country (South Africa). The script opens
various websites (Using [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)), searches for the items listed, gets the current prices and correct item name and then uploads the data to a Google Spreadsheet.
Pretty straight forward.
